             ADFTEST Augmented Dickey-Fuller test for a unit root
             Syntax:
             [h,pValue,stat,cValue,reg] = adftest(y)
             [h,pValue,stat,cValue,reg] = adftest(y,param1,val1,param2,val2,...)
             Description:
             Dickey-Fuller tests assess the null hypothesis of a unit root in a
             univariate time series y. All tests use the model
             y(t) = c + d*t + a*y(t-1) + b1*(1-L)y(t-1)
             + b2*(1-L)y(t-2)
             + ... 
             + bp*(1-L)y(t-p)
             + e(t),
             where L is the lag operator Ly(t) = y(t-1). The null hypothesis
             restricts a = 1. Variants of the test, appropriate for series with
             different growth characteristics, restrict the drift and deterministic
             trend coefficients, c and d, respectively, to be 0. Lagged differences
             bk*(1-L)y(t-k), k = 1, ..., p, "augment" the test to account for serial
             correlations in the innovations process e(t).
             Input Arguments:
             y - Vector of time-series data. The last element is the most recent
             observation. NaNs indicating missing values are removed.
             Optional Input Parameter Name/Value Pairs:
             NAME        VALUE
             'lags'      Scalar or vector of nonnegative integers indicating the
             number p of lagged changes of y to include in the model.
             The default value is 0.
             'model'     String or cell vector of strings indicating the model
             variant. Values are 'AR' (autoregressive), 'ARD'
             (autoregressive with drift), or 'TS' (trend stationary).
             The default value is 'AR'.
             o When the value is 'AR', the null model
             y(t) = y(t-1) + b1*(1-L)y(t-1)
             + b2*(1-L)y(t-2)
             + ... 
             + bp*(1-L)y(t-p)
             + e(t)                   
             is tested against the alternative model
             y(t) = a*y(t-1) + b1*(1-L)y(t-1)
             + b2*(1-L)y(t-2)
             + ... 
             + bp*(1-L)y(t-p)
             + e(t)
             with AR(1) coefficient a &lt; 1.
             o When the value is 'ARD', the null model
             y(t) = y(t-1) + b1*(1-L)y(t-1)
             + b2*(1-L)y(t-2)
             + ... 
             + bp*(1-L)y(t-p)
             + e(t)                   
             is tested against the alternative model
             y(t) = c + a*y(t-1) + b1*(1-L)y(t-1)
             + b2*(1-L)y(t-2)
             + ... 
             + bp*(1-L)y(t-p)
             + e(t)
             with drift coefficient c and AR(1) coefficient a &lt; 1.
             o When the value is 'TS', the null model
             y(t) = c + y(t-1) + b1*(1-L)y(t-1)
             + b2*(1-L)y(t-2)
             + ... 
             + bp*(1-L)y(t-p)
             + e(t)                   
             is tested against the alternative model
             y(t) = c + d*t + a*y(t-1) + b1*(1-L)y(t-1)
             + b2*(1-L)y(t-2)
             + ... 
             + bp*(1-L)y(t-p)
             + e(t)
             with drift coefficient c, deterministic trend coefficient
             d, and AR(1) coefficient a &lt; 1. 
             'test'      String or cell vector of strings indicating the type of
             test statistic. Values are 't1', 't2', or 'F'. The default
             value is 't1'. 
             o When the value is 't1', a standard t statistic
             t1 = (a-l)/se
             is computed from OLS estimates of the AR(1) coefficient a
             and its standard error se in the alternative model. The
             test assesses the significance of the restriction a = 1.
             o When the value is 't2', a lag-adjusted, "unstudentized" t
             statistic
             t2 = T*(a-1)/(1-b1-...-bp)
             is computed from OLS estimates of the AR(1) coefficient a
             and the stationary coefficients b1, ..., bp in the
             alternative model. T is the effective sample size,
             adjusted for lags and missing values. The test assesses
             the significance of the restriction a = 1.
             o When the value is 'F', an F statistic is computed to
             assess the significance of a joint restriction on the
             alternative model. If the value of 'model' is 'ARD', the
             restriction is a = 1 and c = 0. If the value of 'model'
             is 'TS', the restriction is a = 1 and d = 0. An F test is
             invalid when the value of 'model' is 'AR'.
             'alpha'     Scalar or vector of nominal significance levels for the
             tests. Values must be between 0.001 and 0.999. The default
             value is 0.05.
             Scalar or single string parameter values are expanded to the length of
             any vector value (the number of tests). Vector values must have equal
             length. If any value is a row vector, all outputs are row vectors.
             Output Arguments:
             h - Vector of Boolean decisions for the tests, with length equal to the
             number of tests. Values of h equal to 1 indicate rejection of the
             unit-root null in favor of the alternative model. Values of h equal
             to 0 indicate a failure to reject the unit-root null.
             pValue - Vector of p-values of the test statistics, with length equal
             to the number of tests. When the value of 'test' is 't1' or 't2',
             p-values are left-tail probabilities. When the value of 'test' is
             'F', p-values are right-tail probabilities.
             stat - Vector of test statistics, with length equal to the number of
             tests. Statistics are computed using OLS estimates of the
             coefficients in the alternative model.
             cValue - Vector of critical values for the tests, with length equal to
             the number of tests. When the value of 'test' is 't1' or 't2',
             critical values are for left-tail probabilities. When the value of
             'test' is 'F', critical values are for right-tail probabilities.
             reg - Structure of regression statistics from the OLS estimation of 
             coefficients in the alternative model. The number of records is
             equal to the number of tests. Each record has the following fields:
             num         Length of the input series y, with NaNs removed
             size        Effective sample size, adjusted for lags, difference*

             coeff       Estimated coefficient values
             se          Estimated coefficient standard errors
             Cov         Estimated coefficient covariance matrix
             tStats      t statistics of coefficients and p-values
             FStat       F statistic and p-value
             yMu         Mean of y, adjusted for lags, difference*

             yHat        Fitted values of y, adjusted for lags, difference*
             res         Regression residuals
             DWStat      Durbin-Watson statistic
             SSR         Regression sum of squares
             SSE         Error sum of squares
             SST         Total sum of squares
             MSE         Mean squared error
             RMSE        Standard error of the regression
             RSq         R^2 statistic
             aRSq        Adjusted R^2 statistic
             LL          Loglikelihood of data under Gaussian innovations
             AIC         Akaike information criterion
             BIC         Bayesian (Schwarz) information criterion
             HQC         Hannan-Quinn information criterion
             *Lagging and differencing a time series reduce the sample size.
             Absent any presample values, if y(t) is defined for t = 1:N, then
             the lagged series y(t-k) is defined for t = k+1:N. Differencing
             reduces the time base to k+2:N. With p lagged differences, the
             common time base is p+2:N and the effective sample size is N-(p+1).
             Notes:
             o A suitable value for 'lags' must be determined in order to draw valid
             inferences from the test. One method is to begin with a maximum lag,
             such as the one recommended by Schwert [7], and then test down by
             assessing the significance of the coefficient of the largest lagged
             change in y, bp. The usual t statistic is appropriate, as reported in
             the reg output structure. Another method is to combine a measure of
             fit, such as SSR, with information criteria such as AIC, BIC, and
             HQC. These statistics are also reported in the reg output structure.
             Ng and Perron [6] provide further guidelines.
             o The value of 'model' is determined by the growth characteristics of
             the time series being tested, and should be chosen with a specific
             testing strategy in mind. As discussed in Elder &amp; Kennedy [4],
             including too many regressors results in lost power, while including
             too few biases the test in favor of the null. In general, if a series
             is growing, the 'TS' model provides a reasonable trend-stationary
             alternative to a unit-root process with drift. If a series is not
             growing, 'AR' and 'ARD' models provide reasonable stationary
             alternatives to a unit-root process without drift. The 'ARD'
             alternative has mean c/(1-a); the 'AR' alternative has mean 0.
             o Dickey-Fuller statistics follow nonstandard distributions under the
             null, even asymptotically. Critical values for a range of sample
             sizes and significance levels have been tabulated using Monte Carlo
             simulations of the null model with Gaussian innovations and five
             million replications per sample size. For small samples, values are
             valid only for Gaussian innovations; for large samples, values are
             also valid for non-Gaussian innovations. Critical values and p-values
             are interpolated from the tables. Tables for tests of type 't1' and
             't2' are identical to those for PPTEST.
             Example:
             Test GDP data for a unit root using a trend-stationary alternative
             with 0, 1, and 2 lagged differences:
             load Data_GDP
             y = log(Data);
             h = adftest(y,'model','TS','lags',0:2)
             The test fails to reject the unit-root null with each alternative.

             'test'      String or cell vector of strings indicating the type of
             test statistic. Values are 't1', 't2', or 'F'. The default
             value is 't1'. 
             o When the value is 't1', a standard t statistic
             t1 = (a-l)/se
             is computed from OLS estimates of the AR(1) coefficient a
             and its standard error se in the alternative model. The
             test assesses the significance of the restriction a = 1.
             o When the value is 't2', a lag-adjusted, "unstudentized" t
             statistic
             t2 = T*(a-1)/(1-b1-...-bp)
             is computed from OLS estimates of the AR(1) coefficient a
             and the stationary coefficients b1, ..., bp in the
             alternative model. T is the effective sample size,
             adjusted for lags and missing values. The test assesses
             the significance of the restriction a = 1.
             o When the value is 'F', an F statistic is computed to
             assess the significance of a joint restriction on the
             alternative model. If the value of 'model' is 'ARD', the
             restriction is a = 1 and c = 0. If the value of 'model'
             is 'TS', the restriction is a = 1 and d = 0. An F test is
             invalid when the value of 'model' is 'AR'.
             'alpha'     Scalar or vector of nominal significance levels for the
             tests. Values must be between 0.001 and 0.999. The default
             value is 0.05.
             Scalar or single string parameter values are expanded to the length of
             any vector value (the number of tests). Vector values must have equal
             length. If any value is a row vector, all outputs are row vectors.

             tests. Statistics are computed using OLS estimates of the
             coefficients in the alternative model.
             cValue - Vector of critical values for the tests, with length equal to
             the number of tests. When the value of 'test' is 't1' or 't2',

             *Lagging and differencing a time series reduce the sample size.
             Absent any presample values, if y(t) is defined for t = 1:N, then
             the lagged series y(t-k) is defined for t = k+1:N. Differencing
             reduces the time base to k+2:N. With p lagged differences, the
             common time base is p+2:N and the effective sample size is N-(p+1).
             Notes:
             o A suitable value for 'lags' must be determined in order to draw valid
             inferences from the test. One method is to begin with a maximum lag,
             such as the one recommended by Schwert [7], and then test down by
             assessing the significance of the coefficient of the largest lagged
             change in y, bp. The usual t statistic is appropriate, as reported in
             the reg output structure. Another method is to combine a measure of
             fit, such as SSR, with information criteria such as AIC, BIC, and
             HQC. These statistics are also reported in the reg output structure.
             Ng and Perron [6] provide further guidelines.
             o The value of 'model' is determined by the growth characteristics of
             the time series being tested, and should be chosen with a specific
             testing strategy in mind. As discussed in Elder &amp; Kennedy [4],
             including too many regressors results in lost power, while including
             too few biases the test in favor of the null. In general, if a series
             is growing, the 'TS' model provides a reasonable trend-stationary
             alternative to a unit-root process with drift. If a series is not
             growing, 'AR' and 'ARD' models provide reasonable stationary
             alternatives to a unit-root process without drift. The 'ARD'
             alternative has mean c/(1-a); the 'AR' alternative has mean 0.
             o Dickey-Fuller statistics follow nonstandard distributions under the
             null, even asymptotically. Critical values for a range of sample
             sizes and significance levels have been tabulated using Monte Carlo
             simulations of the null model with Gaussian innovations and five
             million replications per sample size. For small samples, values are
             valid only for Gaussian innovations; for large samples, values are
             also valid for non-Gaussian innovations. Critical values and p-values
             are interpolated from the tables. Tables for tests of type 't1' and
             't2' are identical to those for PPTEST.
             Example:
             Test GDP data for a unit root using a trend-stationary alternative
             with 0, 1, and 2 lagged differences:
             load Data_GDP
             y = log(Data);
             h = adftest(y,'model','TS','lags',0:2)
             The test fails to reject the unit-root null with each alternative.

             ADFTEST Augmented Dickey-Fuller test for a unit root
             Syntax:
             [h,pValue,stat,cValue,reg] = adftest(y)

             Description:
             Dickey-Fuller tests assess the null hypothesis of a unit root in a
             univariate time series y. All tests use the model
             y(t) = c + d*t + a*y(t-1) + b1*(1-L)y(t-1)
             + b2*(1-L)y(t-2)
             + ... 
             + bp*(1-L)y(t-p)
             + e(t),
             where L is the lag operator Ly(t) = y(t-1). The null hypothesis
             restricts a = 1. Variants of the test, appropriate for series with
             different growth characteristics, restrict the drift and deterministic
             trend coefficients, c and d, respectively, to be 0. Lagged differences
             bk*(1-L)y(t-k), k = 1, ..., p, "augment" the test to account for serial
             correlations in the innovations process e(t).
             Input Arguments:
             y - Vector of time-series data. The last element is the most recent
             observation. NaNs indicating missing values are removed.

             + e(t)                   
             is tested against the alternative model

             o When the value is 't2', a lag-adjusted, "unstudentized" t
             statistic
             t2 = T*(a-1)/(1-b1-...-bp)

             *Lagging and differencing a time series reduce the sample size.
             Absent any presample values, if y(t) is defined for t = 1:N, then
             the lagged series y(t-k) is defined for t = k+1:N. Differencing
             reduces the time base to k+2:N. With p lagged differences, the
             common time base is p+2:N and the effective sample size is N-(p+1).
             Notes:
             o A suitable value for 'lags' must be determined in order to draw valid
             inferences from the test. One method is to begin with a maximum lag,
             such as the one recommended by Schwert [7], and then test down by
             assessing the significance of the coefficient of the largest lagged
             change in y, bp. The usual t statistic is appropriate, as reported in
             the reg output structure. Another method is to combine a measure of
             fit, such as SSR, with information criteria such as AIC, BIC, and
             HQC. These statistics are also reported in the reg output structure.
             Ng and Perron [6] provide further guidelines.
             o The value of 'model' is determined by the growth characteristics of
             the time series being tested, and should be chosen with a specific
             testing strategy in mind. As discussed in Elder &amp; Kennedy [4],
             including too many regressors results in lost power, while including
             too few biases the test in favor of the null. In general, if a series
             is growing, the 'TS' model provides a reasonable trend-stationary
             alternative to a unit-root process with drift. If a series is not
             growing, 'AR' and 'ARD' models provide reasonable stationary
             alternatives to a unit-root process without drift. The 'ARD'
             alternative has mean c/(1-a); the 'AR' alternative has mean 0.
             o Dickey-Fuller statistics follow nonstandard distributions under the
             null, even asymptotically. Critical values for a range of sample
             sizes and significance levels have been tabulated using Monte Carlo
             simulations of the null model with Gaussian innovations and five
             million replications per sample size. For small samples, values are
             valid only for Gaussian innovations; for large samples, values are
             also valid for non-Gaussian innovations. Critical values and p-values
             are interpolated from the tables. Tables for tests of type 't1' and
             't2' are identical to those for PPTEST.
             Example:
             Test GDP data for a unit root using a trend-stationary alternative
             with 0, 1, and 2 lagged differences:
             load Data_GDP
             y = log(Data);
             h = adftest(y,'model','TS','lags',0:2)
             The test fails to reject the unit-root null with each alternative.

             ADFTEST Augmented Dickey-Fuller test for a unit root
             Syntax:
             [h,pValue,stat,cValue,reg] = adftest(y)
             [h,pValue,stat,cValue,reg] = adftest(y,param1,val1,param2,val2,...)
             Description:
             Dickey-Fuller tests assess the null hypothesis of a unit root in a
             univariate time series y. All tests use the model
             y(t) = c + d*t + a*y(t-1) + b1*(1-L)y(t-1)
             + b2*(1-L)y(t-2)
             + ... 
             + bp*(1-L)y(t-p)
             + e(t),
             where L is the lag operator Ly(t) = y(t-1). The null hypothesis
             restricts a = 1. Variants of the test, appropriate for series with
             different growth characteristics, restrict the drift and deterministic
             trend coefficients, c and d, respectively, to be 0. Lagged differences
             bk*(1-L)y(t-k), k = 1, ..., p, "augment" the test to account for serial
             correlations in the innovations process e(t).
             Input Arguments:
             y - Vector of time-series data. The last element is the most recent
             observation. NaNs indicating missing values are removed.
             Optional Input Parameter Name/Value Pairs:
             NAME        VALUE
             'lags'      Scalar or vector of nonnegative integers indicating the
             number p of lagged changes of y to include in the model.
             The default value is 0.
             'model'     String or cell vector of strings indicating the model
             variant. Values are 'AR' (autoregressive), 'ARD'
             (autoregressive with drift), or 'TS' (trend stationary).
             The default value is 'AR'.
             o When the value is 'AR', the null model
             y(t) = y(t-1) + b1*(1-L)y(t-1)
             + b2*(1-L)y(t-2)
             + ... 
             + bp*(1-L)y(t-p)
             + e(t)                   
             is tested against the alternative model
             y(t) = a*y(t-1) + b1*(1-L)y(t-1)
             + b2*(1-L)y(t-2)
             + ... 
             + bp*(1-L)y(t-p)
             + e(t)
             with AR(1) coefficient a &lt; 1.
             o When the value is 'ARD', the null model
             y(t) = y(t-1) + b1*(1-L)y(t-1)
             + b2*(1-L)y(t-2)
             + ... 
             + bp*(1-L)y(t-p)
             + e(t)                   
             is tested against the alternative model
             y(t) = c + a*y(t-1) + b1*(1-L)y(t-1)
             + b2*(1-L)y(t-2)
             + ... 
             + bp*(1-L)y(t-p)
             + e(t)
             with drift coefficient c and AR(1) coefficient a &lt; 1.
             o When the value is 'TS', the null model
             y(t) = c + y(t-1) + b1*(1-L)y(t-1)
             + b2*(1-L)y(t-2)
             + ... 
             + bp*(1-L)y(t-p)
             + e(t)                   
             is tested against the alternative model
             y(t) = c + d*t + a*y(t-1) + b1*(1-L)y(t-1)
             + b2*(1-L)y(t-2)
             + ... 
             + bp*(1-L)y(t-p)
             + e(t)
             with drift coefficient c, deterministic trend coefficient
             d, and AR(1) coefficient a &lt; 1. 
             'test'      String or cell vector of strings indicating the type of
             test statistic. Values are 't1', 't2', or 'F'. The default
             value is 't1'. 
             o When the value is 't1', a standard t statistic
             t1 = (a-l)/se
             is computed from OLS estimates of the AR(1) coefficient a
             and its standard error se in the alternative model. The
             test assesses the significance of the restriction a = 1.
             o When the value is 't2', a lag-adjusted, "unstudentized" t
             statistic
             t2 = T*(a-1)/(1-b1-...-bp)
             is computed from OLS estimates of the AR(1) coefficient a
             and the stationary coefficients b1, ..., bp in the
             alternative model. T is the effective sample size,
             adjusted for lags and missing values. The test assesses
             the significance of the restriction a = 1.
             o When the value is 'F', an F statistic is computed to
             assess the significance of a joint restriction on the
             alternative model. If the value of 'model' is 'ARD', the
             restriction is a = 1 and c = 0. If the value of 'model'
             is 'TS', the restriction is a = 1 and d = 0. An F test is
             invalid when the value of 'model' is 'AR'.
             'alpha'     Scalar or vector of nominal significance levels for the
             tests. Values must be between 0.001 and 0.999. The default
             value is 0.05.
             Scalar or single string parameter values are expanded to the length of
             any vector value (the number of tests). Vector values must have equal
             length. If any value is a row vector, all outputs are row vectors.
             Output Arguments:
             h - Vector of Boolean decisions for the tests, with length equal to the
             number of tests. Values of h equal to 1 indicate rejection of the
             unit-root null in favor of the alternative model. Values of h equal
             to 0 indicate a failure to reject the unit-root null.
             pValue - Vector of p-values of the test statistics, with length equal
             to the number of tests. When the value of 'test' is 't1' or 't2',
             p-values are left-tail probabilities. When the value of 'test' is
             'F', p-values are right-tail probabilities.
             stat - Vector of test statistics, with length equal to the number of
             tests. Statistics are computed using OLS estimates of the
             coefficients in the alternative model.
             cValue - Vector of critical values for the tests, with length equal to
             the number of tests. When the value of 'test' is 't1' or 't2',
             critical values are for left-tail probabilities. When the value of
             'test' is 'F', critical values are for right-tail probabilities.
             reg - Structure of regression statistics from the OLS estimation of 
             coefficients in the alternative model. The number of records is
             equal to the number of tests. Each record has the following fields:
             num         Length of the input series y, with NaNs removed

             tStats      t statistics of coefficients and p-values

             ADFTEST Augmented Dickey-Fuller test for a unit root
             Syntax:
             [h,pValue,stat,cValue,reg] = adftest(y)
             [h,pValue,stat,cValue,reg] = adftest(y,param1,val1,param2,val2,...)
             Description:
             Dickey-Fuller tests assess the null hypothesis of a unit root in a
             univariate time series y. All tests use the model
             y(t) = c + d*t + a*y(t-1) + b1*(1-L)y(t-1)
             + b2*(1-L)y(t-2)
             + ... 
             + bp*(1-L)y(t-p)
             + e(t),
             where L is the lag operator Ly(t) = y(t-1). The null hypothesis
             restricts a = 1. Variants of the test, appropriate for series with
             different growth characteristics, restrict the drift and deterministic
             trend coefficients, c and d, respectively, to be 0. Lagged differences
             bk*(1-L)y(t-k), k = 1, ..., p, "augment" the test to account for serial
             correlations in the innovations process e(t).
             Input Arguments:
             y - Vector of time-series data. The last element is the most recent
             observation. NaNs indicating missing values are removed.
             Optional Input Parameter Name/Value Pairs:
             NAME        VALUE
             'lags'      Scalar or vector of nonnegative integers indicating the
             number p of lagged changes of y to include in the model.
             The default value is 0.
             'model'     String or cell vector of strings indicating the model
             variant. Values are 'AR' (autoregressive), 'ARD'
             (autoregressive with drift), or 'TS' (trend stationary).
             The default value is 'AR'.
             o When the value is 'AR', the null model
             y(t) = y(t-1) + b1*(1-L)y(t-1)
             + b2*(1-L)y(t-2)
             + ... 
             + bp*(1-L)y(t-p)
             + e(t)                   
             is tested against the alternative model
             y(t) = a*y(t-1) + b1*(1-L)y(t-1)
             + b2*(1-L)y(t-2)
             + ... 
             + bp*(1-L)y(t-p)
             + e(t)
             with AR(1) coefficient a &lt; 1.
             o When the value is 'ARD', the null model
             y(t) = y(t-1) + b1*(1-L)y(t-1)
             + b2*(1-L)y(t-2)
             + ... 
             + bp*(1-L)y(t-p)
             + e(t)                   
             is tested against the alternative model
             y(t) = c + a*y(t-1) + b1*(1-L)y(t-1)
             + b2*(1-L)y(t-2)
             + ... 
             + bp*(1-L)y(t-p)
             + e(t)
             with drift coefficient c and AR(1) coefficient a &lt; 1.
             o When the value is 'TS', the null model
             y(t) = c + y(t-1) + b1*(1-L)y(t-1)
             + b2*(1-L)y(t-2)
             + ... 
             + bp*(1-L)y(t-p)
             + e(t)                   
             is tested against the alternative model
             y(t) = c + d*t + a*y(t-1) + b1*(1-L)y(t-1)
             + b2*(1-L)y(t-2)
             + ... 
             + bp*(1-L)y(t-p)
             + e(t)
             with drift coefficient c, deterministic trend coefficient
             d, and AR(1) coefficient a &lt; 1. 
             'test'      String or cell vector of strings indicating the type of
             test statistic. Values are 't1', 't2', or 'F'. The default
             value is 't1'. 
             o When the value is 't1', a standard t statistic
             t1 = (a-l)/se
             is computed from OLS estimates of the AR(1) coefficient a
             and its standard error se in the alternative model. The
             test assesses the significance of the restriction a = 1.
             o When the value is 't2', a lag-adjusted, "unstudentized" t
             statistic
             t2 = T*(a-1)/(1-b1-...-bp)
             is computed from OLS estimates of the AR(1) coefficient a
             and the stationary coefficients b1, ..., bp in the
             alternative model. T is the effective sample size,
             adjusted for lags and missing values. The test assesses
             the significance of the restriction a = 1.
             o When the value is 'F', an F statistic is computed to
             assess the significance of a joint restriction on the
             alternative model. If the value of 'model' is 'ARD', the
             restriction is a = 1 and c = 0. If the value of 'model'
             is 'TS', the restriction is a = 1 and d = 0. An F test is
             invalid when the value of 'model' is 'AR'.
             'alpha'     Scalar or vector of nominal significance levels for the
             tests. Values must be between 0.001 and 0.999. The default
             value is 0.05.
             Scalar or single string parameter values are expanded to the length of
             any vector value (the number of tests). Vector values must have equal
             length. If any value is a row vector, all outputs are row vectors.
             Output Arguments:
             h - Vector of Boolean decisions for the tests, with length equal to the
             number of tests. Values of h equal to 1 indicate rejection of the
             unit-root null in favor of the alternative model. Values of h equal
             to 0 indicate a failure to reject the unit-root null.
             pValue - Vector of p-values of the test statistics, with length equal
             to the number of tests. When the value of 'test' is 't1' or 't2',
             p-values are left-tail probabilities. When the value of 'test' is
             'F', p-values are right-tail probabilities.
             stat - Vector of test statistics, with length equal to the number of
             tests. Statistics are computed using OLS estimates of the
             coefficients in the alternative model.
             cValue - Vector of critical values for the tests, with length equal to
             the number of tests. When the value of 'test' is 't1' or 't2',
             critical values are for left-tail probabilities. When the value of
             'test' is 'F', critical values are for right-tail probabilities.
             reg - Structure of regression statistics from the OLS estimation of 
             coefficients in the alternative model. The number of records is
             equal to the number of tests. Each record has the following fields:
             num         Length of the input series y, with NaNs removed
             size        Effective sample size, adjusted for lags, difference*
             names       Regression coefficient names			
             coeff       Estimated coefficient values
             se          Estimated coefficient standard errors
             Cov         Estimated coefficient covariance matrix
             tStats      t statistics of coefficients and p-values
             FStat       F statistic and p-value
             yMu         Mean of y, adjusted for lags, difference*
             ySigma      Standard deviation of y, adjusted for lags, difference*
             yHat        Fitted values of y, adjusted for lags, difference*
             res         Regression residuals
             DWStat      Durbin-Watson statistic
             SSR         Regression sum of squares
             SSE         Error sum of squares
             SST         Total sum of squares
             MSE         Mean squared error
             RMSE        Standard error of the regression
             RSq         R^2 statistic
             aRSq        Adjusted R^2 statistic
             LL          Loglikelihood of data under Gaussian innovations
             AIC         Akaike information criterion
             BIC         Bayesian (Schwarz) information criterion
             HQC         Hannan-Quinn information criterion
             *Lagging and differencing a time series reduce the sample size.
             Absent any presample values, if y(t) is defined for t = 1:N, then
             the lagged series y(t-k) is defined for t = k+1:N. Differencing
             reduces the time base to k+2:N. With p lagged differences, the
             common time base is p+2:N and the effective sample size is N-(p+1).
             Notes:
             o A suitable value for 'lags' must be determined in order to draw valid
             inferences from the test. One method is to begin with a maximum lag,
             such as the one recommended by Schwert [7], and then test down by
             assessing the significance of the coefficient of the largest lagged
             change in y, bp. The usual t statistic is appropriate, as reported in
             the reg output structure. Another method is to combine a measure of
             fit, such as SSR, with information criteria such as AIC, BIC, and
             HQC. These statistics are also reported in the reg output structure.
             Ng and Perron [6] provide further guidelines.
             o The value of 'model' is determined by the growth characteristics of
             the time series being tested, and should be chosen with a specific
             testing strategy in mind. As discussed in Elder &amp; Kennedy [4],
             including too many regressors results in lost power, while including
             too few biases the test in favor of the null. In general, if a series
             is growing, the 'TS' model provides a reasonable trend-stationary
             alternative to a unit-root process with drift. If a series is not
             growing, 'AR' and 'ARD' models provide reasonable stationary
             alternatives to a unit-root process without drift. The 'ARD'
             alternative has mean c/(1-a); the 'AR' alternative has mean 0.
             o Dickey-Fuller statistics follow nonstandard distributions under the
             null, even asymptotically. Critical values for a range of sample
             sizes and significance levels have been tabulated using Monte Carlo
             simulations of the null model with Gaussian innovations and five
             million replications per sample size. For small samples, values are
             valid only for Gaussian innovations; for large samples, values are
             also valid for non-Gaussian innovations. Critical values and p-values
             are interpolated from the tables. Tables for tests of type 't1' and
             't2' are identical to those for PPTEST.
             Example:
             Test GDP data for a unit root using a trend-stationary alternative
             with 0, 1, and 2 lagged differences:
             load Data_GDP
             y = log(Data);
             h = adftest(y,'model','TS','lags',0:2)
             The test fails to reject the unit-root null with each alternative.

             + ... 
             + bp*(1-L)y(t-p)
             + e(t)
             with drift coefficient c, deterministic trend coefficient
             d, and AR(1) coefficient a &lt; 1. 
             'test'      String or cell vector of strings indicating the type of
             test statistic. Values are 't1', 't2', or 'F'. The default
             value is 't1'. 
             o When the value is 't1', a standard t statistic
             t1 = (a-l)/se
             is computed from OLS estimates of the AR(1) coefficient a
             and its standard error se in the alternative model. The
             test assesses the significance of the restriction a = 1.
             o When the value is 't2', a lag-adjusted, "unstudentized" t
             statistic
             t2 = T*(a-1)/(1-b1-...-bp)
             is computed from OLS estimates of the AR(1) coefficient a
             and the stationary coefficients b1, ..., bp in the
             alternative model. T is the effective sample size,
             adjusted for lags and missing values. The test assesses
             the significance of the restriction a = 1.
             o When the value is 'F', an F statistic is computed to
             assess the significance of a joint restriction on the
             alternative model. If the value of 'model' is 'ARD', the
             restriction is a = 1 and c = 0. If the value of 'model'
             is 'TS', the restriction is a = 1 and d = 0. An F test is
             invalid when the value of 'model' is 'AR'.
             'alpha'     Scalar or vector of nominal significance levels for the
             tests. Values must be between 0.001 and 0.999. The default
             value is 0.05.
             Scalar or single string parameter values are expanded to the length of
             any vector value (the number of tests). Vector values must have equal
             length. If any value is a row vector, all outputs are row vectors.
             Output Arguments:
             h - Vector of Boolean decisions for the tests, with length equal to the
             number of tests. Values of h equal to 1 indicate rejection of the
             unit-root null in favor of the alternative model. Values of h equal
             to 0 indicate a failure to reject the unit-root null.
             pValue - Vector of p-values of the test statistics, with length equal
             to the number of tests. When the value of 'test' is 't1' or 't2',
             p-values are left-tail probabilities. When the value of 'test' is
             'F', p-values are right-tail probabilities.
             stat - Vector of test statistics, with length equal to the number of
             tests. Statistics are computed using OLS estimates of the
             coefficients in the alternative model.
             cValue - Vector of critical values for the tests, with length equal to
             the number of tests. When the value of 'test' is 't1' or 't2',
             critical values are for left-tail probabilities. When the value of
             'test' is 'F', critical values are for right-tail probabilities.
             reg - Structure of regression statistics from the OLS estimation of 
             coefficients in the alternative model. The number of records is
             equal to the number of tests. Each record has the following fields:
             num         Length of the input series y, with NaNs removed
             size        Effective sample size, adjusted for lags, difference*

             AIC         Akaike information criterion

             HQC         Hannan-Quinn information criterion
             *Lagging and differencing a time series reduce the sample size.
             Absent any presample values, if y(t) is defined for t = 1:N, then
             the lagged series y(t-k) is defined for t = k+1:N. Differencing
             reduces the time base to k+2:N. With p lagged differences, the
             common time base is p+2:N and the effective sample size is N-(p+1).
             Notes:
             o A suitable value for 'lags' must be determined in order to draw valid
             inferences from the test. One method is to begin with a maximum lag,
             such as the one recommended by Schwert [7], and then test down by
             assessing the significance of the coefficient of the largest lagged
             change in y, bp. The usual t statistic is appropriate, as reported in
             the reg output structure. Another method is to combine a measure of
             fit, such as SSR, with information criteria such as AIC, BIC, and
             HQC. These statistics are also reported in the reg output structure.
             Ng and Perron [6] provide further guidelines.
             o The value of 'model' is determined by the growth characteristics of
             the time series being tested, and should be chosen with a specific
             testing strategy in mind. As discussed in Elder &amp; Kennedy [4],
             including too many regressors results in lost power, while including
             too few biases the test in favor of the null. In general, if a series
             is growing, the 'TS' model provides a reasonable trend-stationary
             alternative to a unit-root process with drift. If a series is not
             growing, 'AR' and 'ARD' models provide reasonable stationary
             alternatives to a unit-root process without drift. The 'ARD'
             alternative has mean c/(1-a); the 'AR' alternative has mean 0.
             o Dickey-Fuller statistics follow nonstandard distributions under the
             null, even asymptotically. Critical values for a range of sample
             sizes and significance levels have been tabulated using Monte Carlo
             simulations of the null model with Gaussian innovations and five
             million replications per sample size. For small samples, values are
             valid only for Gaussian innovations; for large samples, values are
             also valid for non-Gaussian innovations. Critical values and p-values
             are interpolated from the tables. Tables for tests of type 't1' and
             't2' are identical to those for PPTEST.
             Example:
             Test GDP data for a unit root using a trend-stationary alternative
             with 0, 1, and 2 lagged differences:
             load Data_GDP
             y = log(Data);
             h = adftest(y,'model','TS','lags',0:2)
             The test fails to reject the unit-root null with each alternative.

             ADFTEST Augmented Dickey-Fuller test for a unit root
             Syntax:
             [h,pValue,stat,cValue,reg] = adftest(y)
             [h,pValue,stat,cValue,reg] = adftest(y,param1,val1,param2,val2,...)
             Description:
             Dickey-Fuller tests assess the null hypothesis of a unit root in a
             univariate time series y. All tests use the model
             y(t) = c + d*t + a*y(t-1) + b1*(1-L)y(t-1)
             + b2*(1-L)y(t-2)
             + ... 
             + bp*(1-L)y(t-p)
             + e(t),
             where L is the lag operator Ly(t) = y(t-1). The null hypothesis
             restricts a = 1. Variants of the test, appropriate for series with
             different growth characteristics, restrict the drift and deterministic
             trend coefficients, c and d, respectively, to be 0. Lagged differences
             bk*(1-L)y(t-k), k = 1, ..., p, "augment" the test to account for serial
             correlations in the innovations process e(t).
             Input Arguments:
             y - Vector of time-series data. The last element is the most recent
             observation. NaNs indicating missing values are removed.
             Optional Input Parameter Name/Value Pairs:
             NAME        VALUE
             'lags'      Scalar or vector of nonnegative integers indicating the
             number p of lagged changes of y to include in the model.
             The default value is 0.
             'model'     String or cell vector of strings indicating the model
             variant. Values are 'AR' (autoregressive), 'ARD'
             (autoregressive with drift), or 'TS' (trend stationary).
             The default value is 'AR'.
             o When the value is 'AR', the null model
             y(t) = y(t-1) + b1*(1-L)y(t-1)
             + b2*(1-L)y(t-2)
             + ... 
             + bp*(1-L)y(t-p)
             + e(t)                   
             is tested against the alternative model
             y(t) = a*y(t-1) + b1*(1-L)y(t-1)
             + b2*(1-L)y(t-2)
             + ... 
             + bp*(1-L)y(t-p)
             + e(t)
             with AR(1) coefficient a &lt; 1.
             o When the value is 'ARD', the null model
             y(t) = y(t-1) + b1*(1-L)y(t-1)
             + b2*(1-L)y(t-2)
             + ... 
             + bp*(1-L)y(t-p)
             + e(t)                   
             is tested against the alternative model
             y(t) = c + a*y(t-1) + b1*(1-L)y(t-1)
             + b2*(1-L)y(t-2)
             + ... 
             + bp*(1-L)y(t-p)
             + e(t)
             with drift coefficient c and AR(1) coefficient a &lt; 1.
             o When the value is 'TS', the null model
             y(t) = c + y(t-1) + b1*(1-L)y(t-1)
             + b2*(1-L)y(t-2)
             + ... 
             + bp*(1-L)y(t-p)
             + e(t)                   
             is tested against the alternative model
             y(t) = c + d*t + a*y(t-1) + b1*(1-L)y(t-1)
             + b2*(1-L)y(t-2)
             + ... 
             + bp*(1-L)y(t-p)
             + e(t)
             with drift coefficient c, deterministic trend coefficient
             d, and AR(1) coefficient a &lt; 1. 
             'test'      String or cell vector of strings indicating the type of
             test statistic. Values are 't1', 't2', or 'F'. The default
             value is 't1'. 
             o When the value is 't1', a standard t statistic
             t1 = (a-l)/se
             is computed from OLS estimates of the AR(1) coefficient a
             and its standard error se in the alternative model. The
             test assesses the significance of the restriction a = 1.
             o When the value is 't2', a lag-adjusted, "unstudentized" t
             statistic
             t2 = T*(a-1)/(1-b1-...-bp)
             is computed from OLS estimates of the AR(1) coefficient a
             and the stationary coefficients b1, ..., bp in the
             alternative model. T is the effective sample size,
             adjusted for lags and missing values. The test assesses
             the significance of the restriction a = 1.
             o When the value is 'F', an F statistic is computed to
             assess the significance of a joint restriction on the
             alternative model. If the value of 'model' is 'ARD', the
             restriction is a = 1 and c = 0. If the value of 'model'
             is 'TS', the restriction is a = 1 and d = 0. An F test is
             invalid when the value of 'model' is 'AR'.
             'alpha'     Scalar or vector of nominal significance levels for the
             tests. Values must be between 0.001 and 0.999. The default
             value is 0.05.
             Scalar or single string parameter values are expanded to the length of
             any vector value (the number of tests). Vector values must have equal
             length. If any value is a row vector, all outputs are row vectors.
             Output Arguments:
             h - Vector of Boolean decisions for the tests, with length equal to the
             number of tests. Values of h equal to 1 indicate rejection of the
             unit-root null in favor of the alternative model. Values of h equal
             to 0 indicate a failure to reject the unit-root null.

             to the number of tests. When the value of 'test' is 't1' or 't2',

             tests. Statistics are computed using OLS estimates of the

             *Lagging and differencing a time series reduce the sample size.
             Absent any presample values, if y(t) is defined for t = 1:N, then
             the lagged series y(t-k) is defined for t = k+1:N. Differencing
             reduces the time base to k+2:N. With p lagged differences, the
             common time base is p+2:N and the effective sample size is N-(p+1).
             Notes:
             o A suitable value for 'lags' must be determined in order to draw valid
             inferences from the test. One method is to begin with a maximum lag,
             such as the one recommended by Schwert [7], and then test down by
             assessing the significance of the coefficient of the largest lagged
             change in y, bp. The usual t statistic is appropriate, as reported in
             the reg output structure. Another method is to combine a measure of
             fit, such as SSR, with information criteria such as AIC, BIC, and
             HQC. These statistics are also reported in the reg output structure.
             Ng and Perron [6] provide further guidelines.
             o The value of 'model' is determined by the growth characteristics of
             the time series being tested, and should be chosen with a specific
             testing strategy in mind. As discussed in Elder &amp; Kennedy [4],
             including too many regressors results in lost power, while including
             too few biases the test in favor of the null. In general, if a series
             is growing, the 'TS' model provides a reasonable trend-stationary
             alternative to a unit-root process with drift. If a series is not
             growing, 'AR' and 'ARD' models provide reasonable stationary
             alternatives to a unit-root process without drift. The 'ARD'
             alternative has mean c/(1-a); the 'AR' alternative has mean 0.
             o Dickey-Fuller statistics follow nonstandard distributions under the
             null, even asymptotically. Critical values for a range of sample
             sizes and significance levels have been tabulated using Monte Carlo
             simulations of the null model with Gaussian innovations and five
             million replications per sample size. For small samples, values are
             valid only for Gaussian innovations; for large samples, values are
             also valid for non-Gaussian innovations. Critical values and p-values
             are interpolated from the tables. Tables for tests of type 't1' and
             't2' are identical to those for PPTEST.
             Example:
             Test GDP data for a unit root using a trend-stationary alternative
             with 0, 1, and 2 lagged differences:
             load Data_GDP
             y = log(Data);
             h = adftest(y,'model','TS','lags',0:2)
             The test fails to reject the unit-root null with each alternative.

             This method will cause a MATLAB figure window to behave as a modal dialog box.
             The method will not return until all the figure windows associated with this
             component have been closed.
             </summary>
             <remarks>
             An application should only call this method when required to keep the
             MATLAB figure window from disappearing.  Other techniques, such as calling
             Console.ReadLine() from the application should be considered where
             possible.</remarks>
